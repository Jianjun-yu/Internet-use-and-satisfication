Replcation File for: internet use and satsifcation of local government 

-------note---------
**stata version does not include did analysis**
**a minor problem was found in version 202011, for better replication place use version 202012**
**version 202011 has only stata file**
**The writing sample only use panel 2012,2014, and 2016. Version 202012 include panel 2010, but the result does not change** 
**The original data is too big to store in githug. You can download them from http://www.isss.pku.edu.cn/cfps/index.htm.
This filed includes the data used in my research and a do filed describe how to create the used data from original data: data-creation.do. **
